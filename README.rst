Django REST Framework bulk CRUD view mixins.

Overview
--------

Django REST Framework comes with many generic views however none
of them allow to do bulk operations such as create, update and delete.
To keep the core of Django REST Framework simple, its maintainer
suggested to create a separate project to allow for bulk operations
within the framework. That is the purpose of this project.
